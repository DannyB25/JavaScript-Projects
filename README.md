## Tic-Tac-Toe
A completely interactive version of the classic tic-tac-toe game. Utilizing Javascript, HTML and CSS, you can enjoy playing the computer to your hearts content. It features sound effects, images, and responsive graphics. Please enjoy!

## The Pizza Project
This project was aimed at creating a basic live pizza ordering system. Using this program you can select the size and toppings of your pizza and then, afterwards, you are returned a receipt and a price that is direct result of the items you selected. That's a spicy meatball! 

## Calculator 
This is an old school four function calculator. It is capable of handling addition, subtraction, multiplation and division. A very practical tool!
